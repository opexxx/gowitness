## introduction

`gowitness` is a website screenshot utility written in Golang, that uses Chrome Headless to generate screenshots of web interfaces using the command line. Both Linux and macOS is supported, with Windows support 'partially working'.

Inspiration for `gowitness` comes from [Eyewitness](https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness). If you are looking for something with lots of extra features, be sure to check it out along with these [other](https://github.com/afxdub/http-screenshot-html) [projects](https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot).

## installation

All you would need is an installation of the latest Google Chrome or Chromium and `gowitness` itself. Binaries are available for download from the [releases](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness/releases) page as part of tagged releases.

To build `gowitness` from source, follow the following steps:

* Ensure you have [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) installed `go get -v -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`
* Clone this repository to your `$GOPATH`'s `src/` directory `go get github.com/sensepost/gowitness`
* cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sensepost/gowitness
* Run `dep ensure` to resolve dependencies
* Use the `go` build tools, or run `make` to build the binaries in the `build/` directory
